# Natural Language to SQL Query Generator for Snowflake

## Project Overview
Transform your data interaction experience with this innovative tool that bridges natural language and database queries. Our platform harnesses the intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert everyday language into precise SQL commands, seamlessly integrated within the Snowflake environment.

## Core Capabilities
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Advanced natural language processing system that understands user intent and generates appropriate SQL queries
- **Database Configuration Tools**: Comprehensive automation scripts for establishing all necessary database components
- **Modern Web Interface**: Intuitive, browser-based dashboard powered by Streamlit technology for effortless interaction

## System Architecture
The solution combines multiple cutting-edge components:
- Natural language processing engine
- SQL query optimization system
- Real-time data visualization tools
- Secure database integration layer
